DL in an hour, (Don't laugh I just get to understand. ..

##Fundament

1. Fit, aprroximation, interpolation, estimation, predict
2. case in real life, spline
 * https://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/Splines/nurbs.html
 * https://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/Splines/bezier3d.html
2. Universal approximation theorem
4. https://github.com/NirViaje/DeepLearningRobotics/blob/master/NeuronTalk.md
 * Hebbian, naive ANN
  * matrix and non-linear
 * XOR, [multi-layer](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)
 * info redundant, constrain
 * localize, convolution, primary visual cortex of mammal, DCF
 * LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet inception, ResNet
  * timeline
  * ReLu, with leakage etc
  * optimization, training, backpropagation, Andrew Ng's course
5. Gu@SUNY, manifold
6. what's more
 * LSTM
 * GAN
 * DRL
 * connect concrete and abstract
  * the figure of three stage
 * further methodology
  * non-BP
  * etc
7. a little bit more on AGI
 * ![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/80/c88b9731c98a2271b744347856f6706c_hd.png)
8. fully DL rendered movie?
 * nVidia be a render company again
 
##HandsOn

1. available workbench in lab
 * 1080Tix3
 * P40x2
2. [Deepo](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo)

##Several Cases

1. on Aesthetic, eyes movement
2. scratch2code etc
3. more
